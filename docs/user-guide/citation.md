## When and how to cite the NorESM-LSP, models, and data
    
If you end up publishing your model experiments, e.g. in a thesis or scientific paper, you need to consider citations, acknowledgements, and authorship invitations carefully.

To cite the NorESM-LSP software, see the [Contributing](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/contributing/) and [About](https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/about/). 

When you publish model experiments, you also need to properly cite and acknowledge the model framework: See the licences of [NorESM](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), [CLM](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/blob/master/LICENSE), [FATES](https://github.com/NGEET/fates/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). In the Acknowledgements section, it is common practice to add funding information of the models that you use (e.g. the U.S. National Science Foundation for CLM, NGEE-Tropics for FATES). The main publications for each model should also be cited in the main text.

If you use observational data, e.g. from the Vestland Climate Grid sites or another integrated site, make sure to look at the licences, rights and conditions attached to those data! 
    
Following international standards for research ethics, authorship invitations should be given based on "substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data", among other things.
